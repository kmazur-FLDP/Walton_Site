# View All Favorites Feature

## Overview
This feature allows administrators to view all favorited parcels for a specific county on the map at once, with special highlighting to distinguish them from other parcels.

## What's New

### Admin Dashboard
- **"View All on Map" Button**: A new button appears in the "All Favorites" tab when there are filtered favorites
  - Shows the count of parcels that will be displayed: `View All on Map (X)`
  - Only works when filtering by a single county
  - If multiple counties are in the filtered results, it shows an alert asking you to filter by a specific county

### Map Pages
Updated map pages now support viewing multiple parcels at once:
- **Manatee County** âœ… Updated
- **Pasco County** âœ… Updated
- **Polk County** âœ… Updated
- **Hernando County** âœ… Updated
- **Citrus County** âœ… Updated

5. The map will open with all filtered parcels highlighted in amber/orange
